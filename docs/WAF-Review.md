# AWS Well-Architected Framework Review – RescueMind

This document evaluates the RescueMind project against the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

---

## 1. Operational Excellence
✅ Infrastructure as Code (CDK)  
✅ Modular stacks (Data, Agent, API)  
⚠️ Missing monitoring & logging (CloudWatch dashboards, alarms)  
⚠️ No CI/CD yet (manual deploy only)  

**Next steps:** Add CloudWatch metrics, CI/CD (GitHub Actions or CodePipeline).

---

## 2. Security
✅ IAM least-privilege policies for Lambdas  
⚠️ Secrets in environment variables (should move to Secrets Manager/SSM)  
⚠️ No explicit audit trail (CloudTrail)  
⚠️ Encryption at rest not enforced  

**Next steps:** Use Secrets Manager, enforce KMS encryption, enable CloudTrail.

---

## 3. Reliability
✅ Event-driven via EventBridge (decoupling services)  
✅ Multi-stack isolation  
⚠️ No DLQs for failed Lambda events  
⚠️ OpenSearch not configured for HA  

**Next steps:** Add DLQs/retries, configure OpenSearch multi-AZ.

---

## 4. Performance Efficiency
✅ Microservice Lambdas (single purpose)  
✅ DynamoDB for low-latency storage  
⚠️ No caching (DAX / API Gateway caching)  
⚠️ Missing scaling policies  

**Next steps:** Add caching & fine-tune Lambda memory.

---

## 5. Cost Optimization
✅ Serverless-first (Lambdas, DynamoDB on-demand, S3)  
⚠️ OpenSearch cluster may be costly → consider OpenSearch Serverless or Athena + S3  
⚠️ No cost monitoring or budgets  

**Next steps:** Enable AWS Budgets, cost anomaly detection.

---

## 6. Sustainability
✅ Serverless reduces idle infra  
⚠️ Lambdas not right-sized (all default 128MB)  
⚠️ No data lifecycle (S3 cleanup, DynamoDB TTLs)  

**Next steps:** Right-size Lambdas, set TTLs and bucket lifecycle rules.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
RescueMind is **well-aligned** with AWS best practices for a prototype.  
Before production, add:  
- Monitoring (CloudWatch, X-Ray)  
- Secrets Manager integration  
- DLQs for reliability  
- Encryption & audit logging  
- Cost governance (Budgets, Alerts)
